        <p class="entry-date">2014-06-03</p>
        <h2>Prerequisite</h2>

<p>Bitwise operation allows programmers to directly operate number variables in low-level perspective. Types of number could include signed and unsigned integer and float-point number (more on this later). Basically in C, you can use the following operations: left shift and right shift (&lt;&lt; and >>), bitwise and, or, xor, not. Here is an interesting and enlightening passage about bitwise operation, which shocked me a lot when I first read it. It's written by Matrix67, a legend person among Chinese math and computer science bloggers. But mind yourself, it is written in Chinese.</p>

<p>OK. If you are familiar with those operations, we can get to the banquet now!</p>

<p>Oh, sorry. One more thing. Without further instruction, all the problems mentioned below can only be solved using &lt;&lt;, >>, &amp;, |, ~, !, ^, + and any control flow statement (if, switch, for, while, ?: statement, etc) and logic operation (&amp;&amp;, ||, etc) is strictly forbidden. Within these rules, you should reduce the total number of operations as much as possible. This gives us the motivation to keep improving our implementation, and then, the fun of this lab.</p>

<h2>Appetizer</h2>

<p>Now I'm gonna show you some higher level usage of bitwise operation by explaning my solutions to the lab problems.</p>

<h3>isEqual</h3>

<pre><code>/* 
 * isEqual - return 1 if x == y, and 0 otherwise 
 *   Examples: isEqual(5,5) = 1, isEqual(4,5) = 0
 *   Legal ops: ! ~ &amp; ^ | + &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;
 *   Max ops: 5
 *   Rating: 2
 */
int isEqual(int x, int y) {
    // To be solved
}
</code></pre>

<p>Quite easy eh. Since we know, one simple way to check if two numbers are identical is to theck the result of xor. Exactly. So we simply return the negation of the xor result. Like the following:</p>

<pre><code>int isEqual(int x, int y) {
    return !(x^y);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This problem is fairly easy, but the idea is important: using xor to check the equivalence of two numbers.</p>

<h3>byteSwap</h3>

<pre><code>/* 
 * byteSwap - swaps the nth byte and the mth byte
 *  Examples: byteSwap(0x12345678, 1, 3) = 0x56341278
 *            byteSwap(0xDEADBEEF, 0, 2) = 0xDEEFBEAD
 *  You may assume that 0 &lt;= n &lt;= 3, 0 &lt;= m &lt;= 3
 *  Legal ops: ! ~ &amp; ^ | + &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;
 *  Max ops: 25
 *  Rating: 2
 */
int byteSwap(int x, int n, int m) {
    // To be solved
}
</code></pre>

<p>At first glance, it's easy. But the first few ideas came to my mind involved if statement. Hmm, need to think over it again. Yeah, maybe I could extract the nth byte out into a variable, right shift n bits, left shift m bits and put it into mth byte. The same to mth byte. Great. So here comes the first version of my solution.</p>

<pre><code>int byteSwap(int x, int n, int m) {
    int nl = 0;
    int ml = 0;
    int nb = 0;
    int mb = 0;
    n &lt;&lt;= 3;
    m &lt;&lt;= 3;

    nl = 0xff &lt;&lt; n;
    ml = 0xff &lt;&lt; m;
    nb = x &amp; nl;
    mb = x &amp; ml;

    nb &gt;&gt;= n;
    nb &lt;&lt;= m;
    nb &amp;= ml;
    mb &gt;&gt;= m;
    mb &lt;&lt;= n;
    mb &amp;= nl;

    x &amp;= ~(nl | ml);
    x |= (nb | mb);
    return x;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Quite readable and easy to understand. But the total operations reaches 17, while many people can reduce it down to 10. How? After carefully inspecting these codes, I found most operations are wasted in shifting to get the nb and mb to the right location. This could be improved. But, how? If I want to change two bytes, I have to clean the target byte with &amp; and put the byte into it with | (or +). Since no if statement available, the source byte cannot be shift to the target location directly using (n-m or m-n) because I cannot decide wheather to shift left or right. Wait. In "isEqual" problem, we use the property of xor that the result of xor of two identical numbers equals 0. And with another property of xor, commutative law, we can eliminate a number just by xor itself! Great idea.</p>

<p>So the solution comes out naturally. We first xor the nth byte and mth byte into a new variable. And then shift left to nth byte and xor the original number. Now the nth byte stores the information of mth byte because we xor nth byte twice. Do the same to mth byte and we successfully exchange two bytes!</p>

<pre><code>int byteSwap(int x, int n, int m) {
    int t = 0;
    n &lt;&lt;= 3;
    m &lt;&lt;= 3;

    t = 0xff &amp; ((x&gt;&gt;n) ^ (x&gt;&gt;m));

    x ^= t&lt;&lt;n;
    x ^= t&lt;&lt;m;

    return x;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Magic xor operation. So another tricky usage of xor. Now, things get more fun.</p>

<h3>sign</h3>

<pre><code>/* 
 * sign - return 1 if positive, 0 if zero, and -1 if negative
 *  Examples: sign(130) = 1
 *            sign(-23) = -1
 *  Legal ops: ! ~ &amp; ^ | + &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;
 *  Max ops: 10
 *  Rating: 2
 */
int sign(int x) {
    // To be solved
}
</code></pre>

<p>In 2's complement, the most significant bit defines it to be a negative (1) or a non-negative (0) number. But it cannot distinguish positive numbers from 0. On the other hand, if we use ! operation, we could distinguish 0 from non-zero numbers, but not positive from negative. So we could combine these two operations and get the answer. One thing to be noted, right shifting an int variable x will result in 0 (when x is non-negative) or -1 (when x is negative; -1 == 0xFFFFFFFF, right shift signed number will automatically fill the sign bit). Here comes the code:</p>

<pre><code>int sign(int x) {
    return ((!x)^1) | (x&gt;&gt;31);
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Main course</h2>

<p>OK. We have seen some easy problems and know how to think in bitwise operation. Now we are taking some real challenges.</p>

<h3>logicalNeg</h3>

<pre><code>/* 
 * logicalNeg - implement the ! operator using any of 
 *              the legal operators except !
 *   Examples: logicalNeg(3) = 0, logicalNeg(0) = 1
 *   Legal ops: ~ &amp; ^ | + &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;
 *   Max ops: 12
 *   Rating: 4 
 */
 int logicalNeg(int x) {
    // To be solved
 }
</code></pre>

<p>To make it more bitwise way, this function should return 0 if in argument has any 1 in any bit, otherwise return 1. In this case, the most obvious way is to or every bit and return the result. Unfortunately, it exceeds the maximun op. But it is a right way. Now that we cannot test only 1 bit at one time, we may test more bits at one time. Half is a good idea.</p>

<p>First, we let the high 16 bits or to low 16 bits of x. Now all the 1(s) in x (if any) comes to low 16 bits of x. And then, let the second byte from the least significant byte or to the least significant byte. All the 1(s) in x (if any) comes to least significant byte. Repeat this process until all the 1s comes to the least significant bit. Now we just need to return the negation of that bit. But the number of operations reaches 12, the maximum limitation. Seems that we need to change a way to think.</p>

<pre><code>int logicalNeg(int x) {
    x |= (x&gt;&gt;16);
    x |= (x&gt;&gt;8);
    x |= (x&gt;&gt;4);
    x |= (x&gt;&gt;2);
    x |= (x&gt;&gt;1);
    x = ~x;
    return x &amp; 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Think deeper, and you will find that the key of this problem lies in distinguishing 0 from non-zero numbers. In bitwise world, 0 is unique because the 2's complement of 0 equals 0 itself, while other numbers are not. But if we solely take advantage of this, we will come back to the awkward situation where we need to find if a number is 0. We should go further.</p>

<p>Transforming a 32-bit number into a 1-bit number mostly depends on one bit (usually either the MSB or the LSB). And the only one bit in a number that is predicable is sign bit (MSB). Think about this. The sign bit of the 2's complement and the origin of a non-zero number must be different. While 0 is the same (both 0). So we can take advantage of this and solve the problem within 6 operations.</p>

<pre><code>int logicalNeg(int x) {
    x = ((~x) &amp; (~(~x+1)))&gt;&gt;31;
    return x &amp; 1;
}
</code></pre>

<h3>howManyBits</h3>

<pre><code>/* howManyBits - return the minimum number of bits required to represent x in
 *             two's complement
 *  Examples: howManyBits(12) = 5
 *            howManyBits(298) = 10
 *            howManyBits(-5) = 4
 *            howManyBits(0)  = 1
 *            howManyBits(-1) = 1
 *            howManyBits(0x80000000) = 32
 *  Legal ops: ! ~ &amp; ^ | + &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;
 *  Max ops: 90
 *  Rating: 4
 */
int howManyBits(int x) {
    // To be solved
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally here comes the real boss. Look at the max op. It's 90! So, let's figure out a way to solve it first. We can quickly realize that positive and negative number can be solved by almost the same way, either counting the number of leading 0s (positive) or leading 1s (negative). And then increase that number by 1 and let 32 substract it. That is the answer. Since the method is same, we first complement x if it is negative:</p>

<pre><code>x ^= (x&gt;&gt;31); // is negative, complement it 
</code></pre>

<p>Well then, fill the bits right to the leading 1 with 1:</p>

<pre><code>x |= x&gt;&gt;1;
x |= x&gt;&gt;2;
x |= x&gt;&gt;4;
x |= x&gt;&gt;8;
x |= x&gt;&gt;16;
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have to count the number of 1 in x. Here I use a method introduced by Matrix67 to do that.</p>

<pre><code>x := (x and $55555555) + ((x shr 1) and $55555555); 
x := (x and $33333333) + ((x shr 2) and $33333333); 
x := (x and $0F0F0F0F) + ((x shr 4) and $0F0F0F0F); 
x := (x and $00FF00FF) + ((x shr 8) and $00FF00FF); 
x := (x and $0000FFFF) + ((x shr 16) and $0000FFFF); 
</code></pre>

<p>I just quote the codes from his blog. It's written in Pascal. Details about how this piece of code work can be found in his blog. I'm not going to duplicate it here. So let's move on.</p>

<p>Now we get the number of 1s in x. And we just have to do some special judgements like returning 32 when given 0x80000000. But look at the total ops, 84. So, let's optimize!</p>

<p>Look at the process of counting 1 in x. That takes too many ops because all the constants must range from 0 to 0xff and we spend so many ops in constructing constants. So, what about adding 1s in every 4 bits at first? That only needs one constant: 0x11111111. We can follow the old idea to add every two neighboring 4-bit into four 8-bit sections? It's good but it needs constant 0x0F0F0F0F.</p>

<p>We can do a hack here. The old idea follows the principle that adding neighboring sections together and the section's space of bit doubles. So the result would not overflow in that new section. But in a 4-bit section, the maximum number of 1 is four. And the maximum number of 1 of two 4-bit sections is eight, which is well within the capacity of a 4-bit section. So we directly add the higher four 4-bit sections into the lower four 4-bit sections respectively.</p>

<p>At last, we extract the lower four 4-bit sections and add them up. That's the answer. It looks like:</p>

<pre><code>// calculate all ones in every 4 bits
x = (x&amp;phr1) + ((x&gt;&gt;1)&amp;phr1) + ((x&gt;&gt;2)&amp;phr1) + ((x&gt;&gt;3)&amp;phr1);

// add the result in low 16 bits
// will not overflow cuz the maximum is 8
x += (x&gt;&gt;16);

// extract lower four 4-bit sections and add them up
x = (x&amp;0xf) + ((x&gt;&gt;4)&amp;0xf) + ((x&gt;&gt;8)&amp;0xf) + ((x&gt;&gt;12)&amp;0xf);
</code></pre>

<p>Now the number of ops comes down to 48. It's a great progress, but still not enough. Following this way might get a little ops down, but only a little. So we need to find another way.</p>

<p>Since it's counting the number of leading 0s, why wouldn't we just count them directly? We can adopt a binary process to count leading 0s. First shift right 16 bits and see if it equals 0. If yes, add 16 to answer or 0 otherwise. Next, shift right 8 bits more (or less, depending on the previous answer value). And then 4 bits, 2 bits and 1 bit. Finally some special cases should be taken care of. So the code should be like this:</p>

<pre><code>n = (!!(x&gt;&gt;16))&lt;&lt;4;
n += (!!(x&gt;&gt;(n+8)))&lt;&lt;3;
n += (!!(x&gt;&gt;(n+4)))&lt;&lt;2;
n += (!!(x&gt;&gt;(n+2)))&lt;&lt;1;
n += (!!(x&gt;&gt;(n+1)));
n += (!!n) + (!(1^x)) + 1;
</code></pre>

<p>So, with this optimization, total ops reduces to 36. From 84 to 36, it's a great leap forward. We beat the boss!</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This lab is excited and time consuming. It took me days to come up to a great optimization. But that was exactly where the fun lies. Can't wait to get my hands on the second lab.</p>
