### Mobile Game Developer
Once I teamed up with a junior and two other classmates ([Ghost][1], [txx][2]) to develop mobile games on iOS platform in my freshman year. Our team was Martin Network and we see ourselves as a start-up. During this time, some of our projects are available online (among which I participated in *[Fishing Joy: Hunting in the Sea][5]*, *[Beautiful Life][3]* and *[Egg Rush][4]*), but there are also many aborted projects that cannot be put on the Internet due to some commercial issues. 

One year and a half later, we received funds from [Chukong Inc.][6] and registered to be a company named Flamingo Tech Inc. We cooperated with other leading companies in China to develop games. Among these games, I participated in *[I'm MT online][7]* and *[Fanren Xiuzhen][8]*. However, as the company growing, I was sick of the administrative stuffs and "office politics". Besides, I have always been dreaming to study abroad. So I left the company and applied for graduate school in my junior year.

### Former Undergraduate at Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou)
Though majoring in Network Engineering, I'm not very interested in the network field. Were I a network engineer, I might have built a safer and faster network, but that's still a pipe. As a programmer, however, I could create colorful contents flowing in that pipe that better entertain and serve human beings. Thus, I see myself as a CSer :P

During the undergraduate, I joined in Guangdong Key Laboratory of Information Security. In the lab, I participated in a research on software protection against reverse engineering. I designed and implemented Dung - a binary obfuscator - in C++, which became my undergraduate thesis. The obfuscator reads in the object files, links them, relocates them, obfuscates them and outputs an executable.

### Graduate Student at Carnegie Mellon University
Now I'm a graduate student in [Information Networking Institute(INI)][9] at Carnegie Mellon University. The first year study is at the main campus of CMU in Pittsburgh. After that, I want to have an internship in Silicon Valley for Summer 2015, and then finish my study in [Silicon Valley campus][10] of CMU.
