description: Thanks to BeiYuu, I designed my blog based on his. Also send my thanks to rex, who helped me a lot about the front-end programming.

The default theme of Jekyll is too simple and looks not very well. After careful search, I found [Jekyll Bootstrap][1] might be a good way to construct my own blog. But the themes JB provides didn't satisfy me. Plus, I know little about front-end and can almost do nothing to change the way it looks like. So I decide to use the style of [BeiYuu][2]. Thank BeiYuu for his generous open source of his own blog.

When constructing this new blog, I learnt so much about the front-end. Without the help of [rex][3], I would not accomplish this. Many thanks to rex, my dear roommate.
